## üöÄ Installation & Setup
1. **Install Dependencies with Composer:**

   composer install
   ```
2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Edit the `/core/.env` file to set up your database and environment settings:
   ```env
   DB_HOST_LOCAL=your_localhost
   DB_USER_LOCAL=your_local_user
   DB_PASS_LOCAL=your_local_password
   DB_NAME_LOCAL=your_local_db

   DB_HOST_REMOTE=your_remote_host
   DB_USER_REMOTE=your_remote_user
   DB_PASS_REMOTE=your_remote_password
   DB_NAME_REMOTE=your_remote_db
   ```

## üîß Framework Initialization
InfernoFramework initializes automatically via `/core/init.php`, which:
- Loads environment variables from `.env`
- Sets up database configurations (local or remote)
- Automatically loads classes from `/core/classes/`

## üõ† Adding New Classes
To extend the framework, follow these simple steps:
1. **Create a New Class File:** Place it inside `/core/classes/`, following the naming convention `ClassName.class.php`.
2. **Define Your Class:**
   ```php
   <?php
   if (!defined('rootsec')) {
       die('Direct access not permitted');
   }

   class ClassName {
       public function exampleFunction() {
           return "Hello, Inferno!";
       }
   }
   ?>
   ```
3. **Start Using Your Class Immediately** ‚Äì The framework‚Äôs autoloader will handle it.

## üìå Usage Guide
### üîπ Helper Class
The `Helper` class provides essential utility functions to streamline development.
#### Example Usage:
```php
$Helper = new Helper($DataBase);

// Sanitize user input
$cleanInput = $Helper->sanitizeInput($dirtyInput);

// Get the current domain
$domain = $Helper->currentDomain();

// Validate email format
$isValid = $Helper->validateEmail("test@example.com");
```

### üîπ SiteConfig Class
The `SiteConfig` class manages site configuration settings stored in the database.
#### Example Usage:
```php
$SiteConfig = new SiteConfig($DataBase);

// Retrieve site name
$siteName = $SiteConfig->getSiteName();

// Retrieve domain information
$domain = $SiteConfig->getDomain();
```

### üîπ UserManager Class
The `UserManager` class handles user authentication and account management, including login, registration, and password recovery.
#### Example Usage:
```php
// Register a new user
$response = $UserManager->register("username", "email@example.com", "password123", "recaptcha_token");

// Log in a user
$response = $UserManager->login("email@example.com", "password123", "recaptcha_token");

// Request password reset
$response = $UserManager->forgotPassword("email@example.com", "recaptcha_token");
```

## üåê API Handling with `api.php`
InfernoFramework includes an `api.php` file that handles API requests through structured classes. The API allows secure interaction with user management features such as login, registration, password reset, and account updates.

## üåç URL Routing
InfernoFramework uses an `.htaccess` file for clean URL routing and API endpoint handling:
This ensures:

- Clean URLs for API requests
- Pretty URLs for web pages
- Automatic redirection to HTTPS and non-www version
- Route for API is yourdomain.com/api/action - api.php
- Route for Views / Pages is yourdomain.com/page - index.php
